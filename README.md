# StorageCollider Contract Description

The `StorageCollider` contract allows you to modify the `array` variable of the abstract contract `ArrayStorage` using the `StorageLibrary` library. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of delegate calls to interact with the `Collision` contract.

## Contract Functionality

1. Modifying the `array` Variable: You can call the `collide` function to modify the `array` variable of the `ArrayStorage` contract.

2. Calling the `Collision` Contract: The `StorageCollider` contract enables you to invoke the `Collision` contract using delegate calls and pass a value of `20` to it.

This README file provides a brief overview of the functionality of the `StorageCollider` contract.
